# bachacovirtual

I'm a c++ student from Caracas, Venezuela. 

I want to create an auction webpage (Ebay style) to barter food, medicines and necessities.
In Venezuela we are living a real humanitarian catastrophe,
Almost every product are imported (medicines, food, medical supply),
and the government is the one that manage the foreign exchange,
Venezuela recieve foreign exchange through oil revenues, 
Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in THE WORLD.

The state (in Venezuelan case, the government party)
is the one that manage the oil revenues,
that has created one of the biggest cases of corruption in human history.

The money that should be used for population's necessities is  in government member's pockets.
People is dying not becuase the illness but for the lack of medicines.
There's no food in the supermarket.
People has created a black market of necessities, where people sell and buy products
depending on their preferences (the kind of money they are willing to pay).

Here's where bachacovirtual comes in.

Right now, there is no place for bidders and applicants of necessities.
well, the really unconfortable black market, that makes you lose money, time,
and even your life if you are medicine dependant.

How bachacovirtual works?
You go to de webpage and open an account. thats free.
To start bidding you should have a product to exchange.
You can exchange your product with another product that other person have,
or you can receive the webpage amount of webpage currency that your product worth.

How you know your product worth?
Because of the average of the auctions that are happening in real time on the webpage
of your product.

So, you receive the amount of the webpage currency on your account and then, you can bid in any
other auction of the webpage depending if you have enough money to pay for the product you are
bidding.

I would like the webpage to have lots of rooms forums where people can discuss, help each other
or make networks.

That's basically the project.
